        &lt;p&gt;Everyone has their first time, and so do I. Many of them are memorable, and many are not. Mine, is more than memorable. It is transformative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sounds like a cliché. But this is indeed a story I need to tell. You see, I come from a small town in China, where the only thing we can do to change our fate is to study hard and try to get good grades. We are called &amp;ldquo;small-town test taker&amp;rdquo;, which means all we are capable of doing is taking tests. And indeed we are, and I was, until that day.&lt;/p&gt;
