{"/aboutme/":{"data":{"":"","who-am-i#Who am I":"Well, although it is kind of silly to define oneself, I am an INFJ, a Master’s student who want to keep exploring AI as a researcher, and a gamer. But most importantly, to answer “who am I” , is up to you:\nFor potential employers, recruiters, and professors I am looking for a PhD program in the next three years. And I am also open to internships in AI research. If you are interested in my research, please contact me by email: doby-xu@outlook.com and I will be happy to send my latest CV.\nMy advisors tend to describe me as independent-minded, creative, suck at writing, but I prefer to describe myself as a person who keeps a tight schedule and is always curious about the world.\nCheck out my work on the permutation equivariance of Transformers and its applications. I mathematically formulated, extended and proved the permutation equivariance of Transformers in both row-wise and column-wise, in both forward and backward passes.\nMy Work Accepted by CVPR'24Permutation Equivariance of Transformer For my peers and fellow researchers I am a shy boy but I am always open to collaborations and discussions. No matter what you are interested in, like how to verify the permutation equivariance of Transformers, or how to beat Malenia, I am always happy to discuss with you.\nAnd also, my blogs would also be potentially helpful to you if you are trying to read my papers.\nFor junior students Although I am not one of the top graduate students in my cohort, I still got some experience to share. My experience may be highly specialized in how to apply for a Master’s program in China, and how to survive an academic journey to the west alone, so switch to my Chinese page if you are interested in that (the switch button is on the bottom left corner)."},"title":"About Me"},"/blog/":{"data":{"":"Here are all my blog posts.\nMay be some little projects, some thoughts, some notes, some experiences, or some stories I have to share."},"title":"Blog"},"/research/":{"data":{"":"Here are all my research works.\nAs a boy who spent the childhood playing games, it is hard for me to resist the temptation of computer science. And as a person who studied computer science, it is hard for me to resist the temptation of AI.\nAI is growing wildly. Just when we all thought more parameters and data would not break the bottleneck, large model showed the emergence of intelligence. I am more than honored to be a part of this era, and to witness all the astonishing breakthroughs, right in the field.\nPrivacy-Preserving Split Learning via Patch Shuffling over TransformersDixi Yao\rPermutation Equivariance of Transformers and Its ApplicationsHengyuan Xu\rHufuHengyuan Xu"},"title":"Research"},"/research/cvpr24/":{"data":{"":" ⚠️ Warning: This page is still under construction.
